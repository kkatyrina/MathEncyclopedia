# Math Encyclopedia
## Build
You should just change working directory to "MathEncyclopedia" and then compile project using Apache Maven.
```shell
cd MathEncyclopedia
mvn compile
```
After this "target/MathEncyclopedia.war" file will be generated and all you need is to deploy it to Java Servlet Container application you prefer (Tomcat, Glassfish, etc.).
